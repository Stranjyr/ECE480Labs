Constant is an object whose value cannot be changed once defined for the design.  
Constants are declared with the following syntax:  
constant _identifier_ : _type_ := _value_;  
For example, the folling code declares a constant int with value of 4  
constant myInt : Integer := 4;  
Constants can be used to store values that are refrenced by input signals. For example, op codes for a simple processor or rollover values for a fixed size counter.
